This project was the eleventh app writen by myself.\
The main functionality that was applied in this project:
- CoreData
- JSON parsing
- UITabBarController
- UINavigationController
- UITableView
- Cells trailing swipe actions
- UIAlertController

The application also has several screens with transitions to them.\
At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design.\
All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).

Disclaimer:
The project was made for educational purposes only.
